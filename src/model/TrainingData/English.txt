Rogue wireless hardware is easy to intr
oduce. Wireless access 
points are relatively 
inexpensive and easily deployed. A well-inten
tioned team of consultants working in a 
conference room might install a 
wireless access point in order to share a single wire port 
in the room. A malicious hacker can sit in 
a cafeteria with a wireless-enabled laptop 
scanning for unencrypted or WE
P-encrypted traffic. In both 
cases, unacceptable risks are 
introduced. Regardless of whether there is 
malicious intent, the introduction of rogue 
hardware can compromise the confidentiality
 and integrity of network traffic. Rogue 
wireless devices can be dete
cted by physically examining in
stallations (known as “war 
driving”), using radio frequency (RF) scanne
rs to determine the location of wireless 
devices, or by using systems designed to 
analyze network traffic for unauthorized 
devices.
